## Overview

This repository contains the source code and content for the "Computer Vision Across the Marine Sciences" Jupyter Book, a comprehensive educational resource designed to bridge the gap between marine science and computer vision. The book serves as the foundation for the University of Washington course OCEAN 462-C and is publicly available at [oceancv.org](https://oceancv.org).

## About the Book

The book teaches how to apply computer vision techniques to marine science challenges through:

- **Interactive Tutorials**: Hands-on Python notebooks covering data preparation, model training, and evaluation
- **Case Studies**: Real-world applications in marine biology, fisheries, and oceanography
- **Integration with Modern Tools**: Examples using YOLO, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face

Topics covered include:
- Introduction to marine imagery and AI fundamentals
- Image annotation, augmentation, and preprocessing
- Classification, object detection, segmentation, and tracking
- Model deployment with Streamlit
- Dataset discovery and selection
- Model sharing and documentation
