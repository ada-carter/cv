## Uploading Files to Hugging Face

There are two primary methods for uploading files to Hugging Face: via the website and via the command-line interface (CLI).

### Method 1: Uploading via the Hugging Face Website

1.  **Log in to Your Hugging Face Account:**
    *   Go to the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/) and log in.
2.  **Navigate to Your Organization:**
    *   Go to the OceanCV organization page.
3.  **Create a New Repository:**
    *   Click on "New Repository."
4.  **Configure the Repository:**
    *   **Repository Name:** Choose a descriptive name for your repository.
    *   **Visibility:** Decide whether the repository should be public or private.
    *   **Repository Type:** Model, Dataset, or Space (Demo).
    *   Add a model card
5.  **Upload Files:**
    *   Drag and drop your files into the repository or use the "Add file" button to upload them.
6.  **Commit Changes:**
    *   Write a commit message describing the changes and click "Commit changes."

### Method 2: Uploading via the Hugging Face CLI

1.  **Install Hugging Face Transformers and associated libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install transformers huggingface_hub
    ```
2.  **Authenticate:**
    *   Log in to your Hugging Face account via the CLI using the following command:

    ```bash
    huggingface-cli login
    ```

    *   You will be prompted to enter your Hugging Face token, which can be found in your account settings on the Hugging Face website.
3.  **Initialize a Git Repository (if not already):**

    ```bash
    git init
    git lfs install
    ```
4.  **Track Large Files (if necessary):**
    *   If you are uploading large files (e.g., model weights), track them using Git LFS:

    ```bash
    git lfs track "*.pt" "*.bin" # example file types
    ```
5.  **Add Files:**

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
6.  **Commit Changes:**

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add initial model files"
    ```
7.  **Create Repository on Hugging Face:**
    *   If you haven't already, create an empty repository on the Hugging Face website.
8.  **Link Local Repository to Remote Repository:**

    ```bash
    huggingface-cli create-repo your-repo-name --organization OceanCV --type model
    git remote add origin https://huggingface.co/OceanCV/your-repo-name
    ```
9.  **Push Files to Hugging Face:**

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

## Best Practices for Uploading

*   **Include a Model Card:** Always include a `README.md` file (model card) that describes your model, its intended use, limitations, and other relevant information.
*   **Use Descriptive File Names:** Use clear and descriptive file names to help others understand the contents of your repository.
*   **Organize Files:** Organize your files into logical directories to make it easier for others to navigate your repository.
*   **Version Control:** Use Git for version control to track changes to your files and collaborate effectively.

By following these steps, you can effectively join the OceanCV Hugging Face organization and upload your models, datasets, or demos for the community to use.
