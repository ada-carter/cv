  abstract={Marine imaging is transforming into a sensor technology applied for high throughput sampling. In the context of habitat mapping, imaging establishes thereby an important bridge technology regarding the spatial resolution and information content between physical sampling gear (e.g., box corer, multi corer) on the one end and hydro-acoustic sensors on the other end of the spectrum of sampling methods. In contrast to other scientific imaging domains, such as digital pathology, there are no protocols and reports available that guide users (often referred to as observers) in the non-trivial process of assigning semantic categories to whole images, regions, or objects of interest (OOI), which is referred to as annotation. These protocols are crucial to facilitate image analysis as a robust scientific method. In this article we will review the past observations in manual Marine Image Annotations (MIA) and provide (a) a guideline for collecting manual annotations, (b) definitions for annotation quality, and (c) a statistical framework to analyze the performance of human expert annotations and to compare those to computational approaches.},

As technology progresses, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are progressively being applied to maritime research, complementing traditional marine forecasting models and observation techniques to some degree. This article takes the artificial intelligence algorithmic model as its starting point, references several application trials, and methodically elaborates on the emerging research trend of mixing machine learning and physical modeling concepts. This article discusses the evolution of methodologies for the building of ocean observations, the application of artificial intelligence to remote sensing satellites, smart sensors, and intelligent underwater robots, and the construction of ocean big data. We also cover the method of identifying internal waves (IW), heatwaves, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and sea ice using artificial intelligence algorithms. In addition, we analyze the applications of artificial intelligence models in the prediction of ocean components, including physics-driven numerical models, model-driven statistical models, traditional machine learning models, data-driven deep learning models, and physical models combined with artificial intelligence models. This review shows the growth routes of the application of artificial intelligence in ocean observation, ocean phenomena identification, and ocean elements forecasting, with examples and forecasts of their future development trends from several angles and points of view, by categorizing the various uses of artificial intelligence in the ocean sector.},

For various data types (images, optical spectra, acoustics, omics, geolocations, biogeochemical profiles, and satellite imagery), we present a historical perspective on applications that proved influential, can serve as templates for new work, or represent the diversity of approaches. Then, we illustrate how machine learning can be used to better understand ecological systems, by combining various sources of marine data. Through this coverage of the literature, we demonstrate an increase in the proportion of marine ecology studies that use machine learning, the pervasiveness of images as a data source, the dominance of machine learning for classification-type problems, and a shift towards deep learning for all data types. This overview is meant to guide researchers who wish to apply machine learning methods to their marine datasets.},

Technological progress regarding video cameras, sensors (such as sounders), battery life and information storage make these techniques now accessible to a majority of users.

In this paper, we review the underwater video techniques that have been developed since the 1950s to investigate and/or monitor coastal biodiversity. Techniques such as remote underwater video, whether baited or not, diver-operated video and towed video are described, along with corresponding applications in the field. We then analyse the complementary of techniques, first from studies comparing video techniques with other observation techniques, whether video-based or not, and second by documenting their respective cost efficiencies. These findings are discussed with respect to current challenges in monitoring and investigating coastal biodiversity. Video should be more often considered and used, either in addition to or as an alternative to diver-based, fishing and acoustic techniques, as it may be particularly suited for monitoring coastal biodiversity in a variety of areas and on larger scales than hitherto and within an ecosystem-based approach to management and conservation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The peak-to-peak distance and 15 types of texture characteristic parameters of images are computed, and the relationship between the amplitude of internal waves and the characteristic parameters of remote-sensing images are also investigated. In addition, based on the correlation difference between these parameters and the amplitude, three types of deep-learning model are established by selecting different parameters as input variables. Results show that the inverted amplitude of internal waves from our models shows good agreement with the in-situ data of internal waves, and the average errors between them are about 6.7%, 4.9%, and 3.6%, respectively, which indicates that the deep-learning model is effective for amplitude inversion of internal waves based on optical remote-sensing images.},

The daily temperature data of Princeton Meteorological Forcing were extracted for 27 points to estimate the annual number of HWDs, and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data were used as predictors. The major synoptic variables were extracted for four pressure levels (e.g., 300, 500, 850, and 1000 hPa) and three monthly time lags. The Principal Component Analysis was employed to reduce the diverse predictors and their features to the most optimal structure. The grid point-based performance evaluation revealed the superiority of ABR-DT, which showed a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.860 and meant absolute error (MAE) of 6.929, using only specific humidity and wind component as predictors. The spatial performance indices over eight different climate regions of Iran also showed the better performance of ABR-DT, which improved the CC and MAE of its two alternatives up to 185 and 19%. The study identified the optimal parameter combination as the predictors of heatwaves by examining the effects of numerous weather components. The results proved the proposed hybrid forecasting approach’s effectiveness in predicting heatwave days, a devastating hazard, for many regions.},

Robust, long-lead forecasts would therefore be valuable for managing policy responses. But despite decades of effort, forecasting ENSO events at lead times of more than one year remains problematic2. Here we show that a statistical forecast model employing a deep-learning approach produces skilful ENSO forecasts for lead times of up to one and a half years. To circumvent the limited amount of observation data, we use transfer learning to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) first on historical simulations3 and subsequently on reanalysis from 1871 to 1973. During the validation period from 1984 to 2017, the all-season correlation skill of the Nino3.4 index of the CNN model is much higher than those of current state-of-the-art dynamical forecast systems. The CNN model is also better at predicting the detailed zonal distribution of sea surface temperatures, overcoming a weakness of dynamical forecast models. A heat map analysis indicates that the CNN model predicts ENSO events using physically reasonable precursors. The CNN model is thus a powerful tool for both the prediction of ENSO events and for the analysis of their associated complex mechanisms.},

   abstract = {The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the main drivers of the interannual climate variability of Earth and can cause a wide range of climate anomalies, so multi year ENSO forecasts are a paramount scientific issue. However, most existing works rely on the conventional iterative mechanism and, thus, fail to provide reliable long-term predictions due to error accumulation. Although methods based on deep learning (DL) apply the parallel modeling scheme for different lead times instead of a single iteration model, they leverage the same DL model for prediction, which can not fully mine the variability of different lead times, resulting in a decrease of prediction accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose a novel parallel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with a heterogeneous architecture. In this study, by adaptively selecting network architectures for different lead times, we realize variability modeling of different tasks (lead times) and thereby improve the reliability of long-term predictions. Furthermore, we propose a relationship between different prediction lead times and neural network architecture from a unique perspective, namely, the receptive field originally proposed in computer vision. According to the spatio-temporal correlated area and sampling scale of lead times, the size of the convolution kernel and the mesh size of sampling are adjusted as the lead time increases. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) from 1861 to 2004 and the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) from 1871 to 1973 were used for model training, and the GODAS from 1982 to 2017 were used for testing the forecast skill of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other well-known methods, especially for long-term predictions.},

Therefore, more discriminative feature extraction can be achieved by the MLFN. Furthermore, the fine-tune strategy is utilized to optimize the network parameters. The experimental results on two real sea ice data sets demonstrated that the proposed method achieved better performance than other competitive methods.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a three-stage approach for the automated analysis of close-range optical images containing ice objects. The proposed system is based on an ensemble of deep learning models and conditional random field postprocessing. The following surface ice formations were considered: Icebergs, Deformed ice, Level ice, Broken ice, Ice floes, Floebergs, Floebits, Pancake ice, and Brash ice. Additionally, five non-surface ice categories were considered: Sky, Open water, Shore, Underwater ice, and Melt ponds. To find input parameters for the approach, the performance of 12 different neural network architectures was explored and evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. The best performance was achieved using an ensemble of models having pyramid pooling layers (PSPNet, PSPDenseNet, DeepLabV3+, and UPerNet) and convolutional conditional random field postprocessing with a mean intersection over union score of 0.799, and this outperformed the best single-model approach. The results of this study show that when per-class performance was considered, the Sky was the easiest class to predict, followed by Deformed ice and Open water. Melt pond was the most challenging class to predict. Furthermore, we have extensively explored the strengths and weaknesses of our approach and, in the process, discovered the types of scenes that pose a more significant challenge to the underlying neural networks. When coupled with optical sensors and AIS, the proposed approach can serve as a supplementary source of large-scale 'ground truth' data for validation of satellite-based sea-ice products. We have provided an implementation of the approach at https://github.com/panchinabil/sea_ice_segmentation.},
