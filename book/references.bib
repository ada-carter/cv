  abstract = {Marine visual imaging has become a major assessment tool in the science, policy, and public understanding of our seas and oceans. The technology to acquire and process this imagery has significantly evolved in recent years through the development of new camera platforms, camera types, lighting systems, and analytical software. These advances have led to new challenges in imaging, including storage and management of 'big data', enhancement of digital photos, and the extraction of biological and ecological data. The need to address these challenges, within and beyond the scientific community, is set to substantially increase in the near future, as imaging is increasingly used in the designation and evaluation of marine conservation areas as well as for the assessment of environmental baselines and impact monitoring of various marine industries. We review the state of the theory, techniques, and technologies associated with each of the steps of marine imaging for observation and research and provide an outlook on the future from our perspective as active science and engineering developers and users.},

  abstract = {© 2017 ACM. There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

   abstract = {Sampling in the deep sea (200-11,000 m) presents unique challenges to scientists because of the distance to the seafloor from the surface and the high hydrostatic pressures found at depth. While there are a myriad of methods and techniques currently available to sample the deep-sea floor, described herein are the most common methods, techniques and tools current available. These range from methods of collecting organisms (e.g. trawls, sleds and traps), sampling sediments (e.g. grabs and corers), imaging the seafloor and fauna (e.g. landers, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs)) and in situ experimentation. Also described are generic sampling operations from modern research vessels including subsea tracking and positioning of gear, and future developments.

   abstract = {Underwater video techniques are increasingly used in marine ecology studies. Technological progress regarding video cameras, sensors (such as sounders), battery life and information storage make these techniques now accessible to a majority of users. However, diver-based underwater visual censuses, and catch and effort data, remain the most commonly used for observing coastal biodiversity and species. In this paper, we review the underwater video techniques that have been developed since the 1950s to investigate and/or monitor coastal biodiversity. Techniques such as remote underwater video, whether baited or not, diver-operated video and towed video are described, along with corresponding applications in the field. We then analyse the complementary of techniques, first from studies comparing video techniques with other observation techniques, whether video-based or not, and second by documenting their respective cost efficiencies. These findings are discussed with respect to current challenges in monitoring and investigating coastal biodiversity. Video should be more often considered and used, either in addition to or as an alternative to diver-based, fishing and acoustic techniques, as it may be particularly suited for monitoring coastal biodiversity in a variety of areas and on larger scales than hitherto and within an ecosystem-based approach to management and conservation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},
