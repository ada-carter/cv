  abstract = {Marine visual imaging has become a major assessment tool in the science, policy, and public understanding of our seas and oceans. The technology to acquire and process this imagery has significantly evolved in recent years through the development of new camera platforms, camera types, lighting systems, and analytical software. These advances have led to new challenges in imaging, including storage and management of 'big data', enhancement of digital photos, and the extraction of biological and ecological data. The need to address these challenges, within and beyond the scientific community, is set to substantially increase in the near future, as imaging is increasingly used in the designation and evaluation of marine conservation areas as well as for the assessment of environmental baselines and impact monitoring of various marine industries. We review the state of the theory, techniques, and technologies associated with each of the steps of marine imaging for observation and research and provide an outlook on the future from our perspective as active science and engineering developers and users.},

  abstract = {© 2017 ACM. There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

   abstract = {Sampling in the deep sea (200-11,000 m) presents unique challenges to scientists because of the distance to the seafloor from the surface and the high hydrostatic pressures found at depth. While there are a myriad of methods and techniques currently available to sample the deep-sea floor, described herein are the most common methods, techniques and tools current available. These range from methods of collecting organisms (e.g. trawls, sleds and traps), sampling sediments (e.g. grabs and corers), imaging the seafloor and fauna (e.g. landers, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs)) and in situ experimentation. Also described are generic sampling operations from modern research vessels including subsea tracking and positioning of gear, and future developments.

   abstract = {Underwater video techniques are increasingly used in marine ecology studies. Technological progress regarding video cameras, sensors (such as sounders), battery life and information storage make these techniques now accessible to a majority of users. However, diver-based underwater visual censuses, and catch and effort data, remain the most commonly used for observing coastal biodiversity and species. In this paper, we review the underwater video techniques that have been developed since the 1950s to investigate and/or monitor coastal biodiversity. Techniques such as remote underwater video, whether baited or not, diver-operated video and towed video are described, along with corresponding applications in the field. We then analyse the complementary of techniques, first from studies comparing video techniques with other observation techniques, whether video-based or not, and second by documenting their respective cost efficiencies. These findings are discussed with respect to current challenges in monitoring and investigating coastal biodiversity. Video should be more often considered and used, either in addition to or as an alternative to diver-based, fishing and acoustic techniques, as it may be particularly suited for monitoring coastal biodiversity in a variety of areas and on larger scales than hitherto and within an ecosystem-based approach to management and conservation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, offers various methods that can be applied in marine science. It supports data-driven learning, which can result in automated decision making of de novo data. It has significant advantages compared with manual analyses that are labour intensive and require considerable time. Machine learning approaches have great potential to improve the quality and extent of marine research by identifying latent patterns and hidden trends, particularly in large datasets that are intractable using other approaches. New sensor technology supports collection of large amounts of data from the marine environment. The rapidly developing machine learning subfield known as deep learning—which applies algorithms (artificial neural networks) inspired by the structure and function of the brain—is able to solve very complex problems by processing big datasets in a short time, sometimes achieving better performance than human experts. Given the opportunities that machine learning can provide, its integration into marine science and marine resource management is inevitable. The purpose of this themed set of articles is to provide as wide a selection as possible of case studies that demonstrate the applications, utility, and promise of machine learning in marine science. We also provide a forward-look by envisioning a marine science of the future into which machine learning has been fully incorporated.},

   abstract = {Utilization and exploitation of marine resources by humans have contributed to the growth of marine research. As technology progresses, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are progressively being applied to maritime research, complementing traditional marine forecasting models and observation techniques to some degree. This article takes the artificial intelligence algorithmic model as its starting point, references several application trials, and methodically elaborates on the emerging research trend of mixing machine learning and physical modeling concepts. This article discusses the evolution of methodologies for the building of ocean observations, the application of artificial intelligence to remote sensing satellites, smart sensors, and intelligent underwater robots, and the construction of ocean big data. We also cover the method of identifying internal waves (IW), heatwaves, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and sea ice using artificial intelligence algorithms. In addition, we analyze the applications of artificial intelligence models in the prediction of ocean components, including physics-driven numerical models, model-driven statistical models, traditional machine learning models, data-driven deep learning models, and physical models combined with artificial intelligence models. This review shows the growth routes of the application of artificial intelligence in ocean observation, ocean phenomena identification, and ocean elements forecasting, with examples and forecasts of their future development trends from several angles and points of view, by categorizing the various uses of artificial intelligence in the ocean sector.},

   abstract = {Machine learning covers a large set of algorithms that can be trained to identify patterns in data. Thanks to the increase in the amount of data and computing power available, it has become pervasive across scientific disciplines. We first highlight why machine learning is needed in marine ecology. Then we provide a quick primer on machine learning techniques and vocabulary. We built a database of ∼1000 publications that implement such techniques to analyse marine ecology data. For various data types (images, optical spectra, acoustics, omics, geolocations, biogeochemical profiles, and satellite imagery), we present a historical perspective on applications that proved influential, can serve as templates for new work, or represent the diversity of approaches. Then, we illustrate how machine learning can be used to better understand ecological systems, by combining various sources of marine data. Through this coverage of the literature, we demonstrate an increase in the proportion of marine ecology studies that use machine learning, the pervasiveness of images as a data source, the dominance of machine learning for classification-type problems, and a shift towards deep learning for all data types. This overview is meant to guide researchers who wish to apply machine learning methods to their marine datasets.},

   abstract = {Marine imaging is transforming into a sensor technology applied for high throughput sampling. In the context of habitat mapping, imaging establishes thereby an important bridge technology regarding the spatial resolution and information content between physical sampling gear (e.g., box corer, multi corer) on the one end and hydro-acoustic sensors on the other end of the spectrum of sampling methods. In contrast to other scientific imaging domains, such as digital pathology, there are no protocols and reports available that guide users (often referred to as observers) in the non-trivial process of assigning semantic categories to whole images, regions, or objects of interest (OOI), which is referred to as annotation. These protocols are crucial to facilitate image analysis as a robust scientific method. In this article we will review the past observations in manual Marine Image Annotations (MIA) and provide (a) a guideline for collecting manual annotations, (b) definitions for annotation quality, and (c) a statistical framework to analyze the performance of human expert annotations and to compare those to computational approaches.},
