  abstract={Marine imaging is transforming into a sensor technology applied for high throughput sampling. In the context of habitat mapping, imaging establishes thereby an important bridge technology regarding the spatial resolution and information content between physical sampling gear (e.g., box corer, multi corer) on the one end and hydro-acoustic sensors on the other end of the spectrum of sampling methods. In contrast to other scientific imaging domains, such as digital pathology, there are no protocols and reports available that guide users (often referred to as observers) in the non-trivial process of assigning semantic categories to whole images, regions, or objects of interest (OOI), which is referred to as annotation. These protocols are crucial to facilitate image analysis as a robust scientific method. In this article we will review the past observations in manual Marine Image Annotations (MIA) and provide (a) a guideline for collecting manual annotations, (b) definitions for annotation quality, and (c) a statistical framework to analyze the performance of human expert annotations and to compare those to computational approaches.},

   abstract = {Utilization and exploitation of marine resources by humans have contributed to the growth of marine research. As technology progresses, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are progressively being applied to maritime research, complementing traditional marine forecasting models and observation techniques to some degree. This article takes the artificial intelligence algorithmic model as its starting point, references several application trials, and methodically elaborates on the emerging research trend of mixing machine learning and physical modeling concepts. This article discusses the evolution of methodologies for the building of ocean observations, the application of artificial intelligence to remote sensing satellites, smart sensors, and intelligent underwater robots, and the construction of ocean big data. We also cover the method of identifying internal waves (IW), heatwaves, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and sea ice using artificial intelligence algorithms. In addition, we analyze the applications of artificial intelligence models in the prediction of ocean components, including physics-driven numerical models, model-driven statistical models, traditional machine learning models, data-driven deep learning models, and physical models combined with artificial intelligence models. This review shows the growth routes of the application of artificial intelligence in ocean observation, ocean phenomena identification, and ocean elements forecasting, with examples and forecasts of their future development trends from several angles and points of view, by categorizing the various uses of artificial intelligence in the ocean sector.},

Thanks to the increase in the amount of data and computing power available, it has become pervasive across scientific disciplines. We first highlight why machine learning is needed in marine ecology. Then we provide a quick primer on machine learning techniques and vocabulary. We built a database of ∼1000 publications that implement such techniques to analyse marine ecology data. For various data types (images, optical spectra, acoustics, omics, geolocations, biogeochemical profiles, and satellite imagery), we present a historical perspective on applications that proved influential, can serve as templates for new work, or represent the diversity of approaches. Then, we illustrate how machine learning can be used to better understand ecological systems, by combining various sources of marine data. Through this coverage of the literature, we demonstrate an increase in the proportion of marine ecology studies that use machine learning, the pervasiveness of images as a data source, the dominance of machine learning for classification-type problems, and a shift towards deep learning for all data types. This overview is meant to guide researchers who wish to apply machine learning methods to their marine datasets.},

However, like many other systems UAVs also need navigation. But, it’s not safe to use only one navigation system for various reasons. The recent increase in the number of cyberattacks is one of these reasons. Failure of the navigation system can cause the UAV to lose control. This, in turn, can lead to serious accidents. Therefore, this work analyzes various techniques to ensure the autonomous navigation of UAVs. Also, the advantages and disadvantages of each technique are discussed. Finally, the implementation of these techniques with Kalman filters (KF), deep learning, and machine learning is demonstrated and the results of various studies on this subject are also highlighted.},

These advances have led to new challenges in imaging, including storage and management of 'big data', enhancement of digital photos, and the extraction of biological and ecological data. The need to address these challenges, within and beyond the scientific community, is set to substantially increase in the near future, as imaging is increasingly used in the designation and evaluation of marine conservation areas as well as for the assessment of environmental baselines and impact monitoring of various marine industries.

Technological progress regarding video cameras, sensors (such as sounders), battery life and information storage make these techniques now accessible to a majority of users. However, diver-based underwater visual censuses, and catch and effort data, remain the most commonly used for observing coastal biodiversity and species. In this paper, we review the underwater video techniques that have been developed since the 1950s to investigate and/or monitor coastal biodiversity. Techniques such as remote underwater video, whether baited or not, diver-operated video and towed video are described, along with corresponding applications in the field. We then analyse the complementary of techniques, first from studies comparing video techniques with other observation techniques, whether video-based or not, and second by documenting their respective cost efficiencies. These findings are discussed with respect to current challenges in monitoring and investigating coastal biodiversity. Video should be more often considered and used, either in addition to or as an alternative to diver-based, fishing and acoustic techniques, as it may be particularly suited for monitoring coastal biodiversity in a variety of areas and on larger scales than hitherto and within an ecosystem-based approach to management and conservation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

However, there is no analytic method developed for the amplitude inversion of internal waves based on optical remote-sensing images. In this article, the deep-learning model is introduced to inverse the amplitude of internal waves based on a large number of optical remote-sensing images. The peak-to-peak distance and 15 types of texture characteristic parameters of images are computed, and the relationship between the amplitude of internal waves and the characteristic parameters of remote-sensing images are also investigated. In addition, based on the correlation difference between these parameters and the amplitude, three types of deep-learning model are established by selecting different parameters as input variables. Results show that the inverted amplitude of internal waves from our models shows good agreement with the in-situ data of internal waves, and the average errors between them are about 6.7%, 4.9%, and 3.6%, respectively, which indicates that the deep-learning model is effective for amplitude inversion of internal waves based on optical remote-sensing images.},

The research results show that the proposed method can identify whether the SAR images contain oceanic internal waves and obtain the respective locations of the light and dark stripes of the oceanic internal waves from SAR images. Furthermore, because this method can accurately determine the relative locations of the light and dark stripes, it can distinguish the moment when oceanic internal waves undergo polarity conversion.},

It supports data-driven learning, which can result in automated decision making of de novo data.

New sensor technology supports collection of large amounts of data from the marine environment.
