# Marine Imaging

## Overview
This section provides a non-comprehensive review of the field of marine imaging. We will explore some history of the field of marine imagery, the types of research that utilize imagery in the marine environment, some challenges inherent to using marine imagery in the marine environment.

There has been a long tradition of using images to answer scientific questions about marine environments as well as a tradition of using underwater photography to make marine environments accessible and exciting for the public {cite}`Kocak2005, Durden2016`. With the non-destructive nature of imaging and the ability to capture and visualize fauna, flora, geologic structures, litter, and infrastructure at all depths and across all underwater environments imaging has become one of the most important tools for studying the oceans. Imagery can be used in scientific studies on spatial scales from several square kilometers down to the millimeter scale. The first underwater images were captured on a pole-mounted system in 1856 {cite}`Baker1997`. Now a wide variety of underwater platforms exist that can be equipped with high resolution cameras that can capture image data ranging from still images to video recordings to hyper-spectral data in volumes from gigabytes to terrabytes (see [Ocean Image Data](book/OceanImageTypes.md) for examples of these platforms).  

The sheer volume of imagery data has been growing rapidly as the technology to acquire and process imagery has significantly evolved in recent years. This evolution has extended to the development of new imaging types, camera platforms, lighting systems, and analytical software. To utilize marine images for scientific study data - qualitative or quantitative - must be extracted from the images. Currently manual data extraction by trained specialists is the major bottleneck for the use of marine imagery globally. As noted by {cite:t}`Schoening2016`, with ever growing image data collections the traditional approach of one observer manually viewing and annotating all images is no longer feasible. 




## Types of studies that use marine images

Imagery can be utilized in a variety of scientific studies. It can be used on its own or in conjunction with other data types. The studies can range from purely exploratory to stricter hypothesis testing and can have spatial and/or temporal domains. Below are some types of studies that utilize marine images along with example publications.

- Ecologic Surveys
- Habitat Mapping
- Animal Behaviour


## Challenges for imaging in the marine environment

There are several inherent challenges to using imaging techniques in the marine environment these include **optical** and **environmental** challenges.
