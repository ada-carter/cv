## Annotating images
In "Image Annotation" we will explore explore image annotation techniques and their importance in training computer vision models, but here we want to provide some general context for on image annotations in marine imaging. Annotating images has been a key component of marine studies using imagery and an often discussed subject even before the incorporation of image annotations into machine learning techniques came on to the scene.
