# Welcome to Computer Vision Across Oceanography

This textbook aims to provide a comprehensive guide to applying **Computer Vision (CV)** techniques in the field of **Oceanography**. You'll explore how modern-day CV techniques can help with interpreting oceanic image data, building models, and understanding marine environments through visual data. 

The book is structured to cover both **theoretical foundations** and **practical implementations** using **Python**, **PyTorch**, and marine datasets. You’ll also work on real-world datasets from open-source repositories to solidify your understanding.

## Who is this book for?

This book is designed for:
- **Marine Science Students** looking to leverage Computer Vision for analyzing marine data.
- **Computer Vision enthusiasts** interested in exploring real-world applications in marine scientists.
- **Data Scientists and Machine Learning practitioners** looking to deepen their understanding of CV techniques.
