This textbook aims to provide a comprehensive and interactive guide to applying **Computer Vision (CV)** techniques in the fields of **Marine Biology**, **Fisheries** and, **Oceanography**. You'll explore how modern-day CV techniques can help with interpreting oceanic image data, building models, and understanding marine environments through visual data. 

The book is structured to cover both **theoretical foundations** and **practical implementations** using **Python**, **PyTorch**, **Tensorflow** and marine datasets. Youâ€™ll also work on real-world datasets from open-source repositories to solidify your understanding.

## Who is this book for?

This book is designed for:
- **Marine Science Students** looking to leverage Computer Vision for analyzing marine data.
- **Computer Vision enthusiasts** interested in exploring real-world applications in the marine sciences.
- **Data Scientists and Machine Learning practitioners** looking to deepen their understanding of CV techniques.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this textbook, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamentals of marine image data and how it can be processed using Python.
- Build and train basic deep learning models using PyTorch for marine datasets.
- Analyze and interpret training results such as confusion matrices and training graphs.
- Apply modern CV techniques to real-world marine research datasets.
